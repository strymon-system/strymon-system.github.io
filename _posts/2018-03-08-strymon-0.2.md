title: Strymon 0.2 Released
---

We are pleased to announce a new release of [Strymon](http://strymon.systems.ethz.ch/index.html) Core. This release comes with a redesigned publish-subscribe subsystem, overhauled documentation and testing, and other various bug fixes and improvements.

### Notable changes

We have merged 23 pull requests since the last release. Some notable changes include:

  - We introduced a new, slimmer [client library][`strymon_job`] for writing Strymon jobs. The new library also implements our completely redesigned publish-subscribe protocol, which preserves epoch atomicity and supports subscribing to multiple stream partitions at once. The [design document](https://strymon-system.github.io/docs/pubsub-protocol) for the new mechanism can be found on our website. PR [#25], [#30].
  - The source code of all our library crates is now fully documented and enforces the `#![deny(missing_docs)]` lint. We now also host the [API documentation](https://strymon-system.github.io/strymon-core/) for Strymon Core on our website. PR [#26], [#28], [#37], [#43], and [#45].
  - We have continued the modularization of `strymon-core` into smaller crates. See our [navigating the source code](https://strymon-system.github.io/docs/codebase-structure) document for a brief overview. PR [#33].
  - Incoming requests in [`strymon_communication`] can now have a custom associated type, allowing for stricter type checks at compile-time. PR [#22].
  - Strymon v0.2 is now based on Timely and Differential Dataflow v0.5. PR [#35].
